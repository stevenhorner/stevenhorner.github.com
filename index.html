<p>Myself and Traci actually did this walk 18 months ago in June 2013, but for some reason I never got around to writing it up. I made extensive notes on the actual days and this is the write up of those notes. Hopefully someone will find this useful.</p>

<p>We were looking for a summer holiday to relax but me being me, I wanted something a bit different. I have always hated sitting around a pool or lazing on a beach. Initially we were looking at Greece and I was contemplating adding a walk up Mount Olympus as you do on your relaxing summer holiday. Yet even with the supposed problems with the Greek economy at the time the holidays were still expensive. I decided to see what else was available that had mountains nearby. Somewhere I had never considered jumped out at me when I realised that the Atlas mountains were close by. The destination was Marrakech.</p>

<p>The obvious target if you have a couple of days to walk in the Atlas mountain is Mt Toubkal, the highest mountain in North Africa at 13,671 ft (4,167 m). It&#8217;s a big step up in height for anyone used to the mountains of the UK and something else to consider is the heat in summer.</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>

<p>I started planning the walk several months before the trip and found a couple of useful sites on the internet, the best of which is <a href="http://www.brainstorming.co.uk/walking/mounttoubkalroutedescription.html">here</a> where you can also download KML files of the route. You will also need a map and the best map available from my research is the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1904207472/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1904207472&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21">Cordee Toubkal and Marrakech Map at 1:50,000</a>. Most of the other maps are less detailed or old.</p>

<p>I also bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1873756771/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1873756771&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21">Moroccan Atlas - The Trekking Guide Book</a> which has a detailed drawn map of the route with lots of extra information.</p>

<h2>Huts or Camping</h2>

<p>The previously mentioned site describes doing it in 1 day, which is certainly achievable if you can set off early, know you are fine at altitude and are fit. My plan was to take 2 days and stay in a one of the refuges on the mountain. There are 2 to choose from and are next door to each other at the South col. The original French <a href="http://www.refugedutoubkal.com/en/index.html">CAF Neltner</a> hut or the newer <a href="http://www.refugetoubkal.com/uk/">Les Mouflon de Toubkal</a> which is where I chose.</p>

<p>I contacted Les Mouflon de Toubkal by email a couple of months before our trip and booked 2 beds in the dormitory which we were told would cost 286 MAD (£21) each for dinner, bed and breakfast. I beleive this is now 319 MAD (£23.50) each. When we actually got there I was told the dorm would be 500 MAD (£37) for us as a couple, so a little cheaper. We decided to actually pay the extra for a room, which cost us 800 MAD (£59) and personally I think this is a better option. The cost of a room is now 950 MAD (£70).</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20032.JPG" alt="camping" />
The camping options are limited at higher altitudes, due to the ground being very rocky. You can pay at the refuge for a dusty pitch for 20 MAD (£1.50), there were a few tents slightly below the refuge but I&#8217;m not sure I would want to be pitched there.</p>

<h2>Food and Water</h2>

<p>You need to plan your food and water carefully, the temperatures can be over 40c in Imlil and once out of the village there is no shade. We carried around 4-5 litres of water for the trip from Imlil to the hostel. To be honest this was not enough between 2 of us in the temperatures we experiences at the height of the day.</p>

<p>There are places on the way up where you can buy water or other drinks. Yet most were closed when we passed, other than at Sidi Chamharouch where there were several places you could sit down and drink or hide from the sun. We didn&#8217;t stop here though due to time. As for food, again the same places that sold drinks also would have a few things, generally fruit. This was probably our weakest point, the only food we took with us we had scavenged from our hotel breakfast, mainly bread. Plan this better than we did, you will need fuel.</p>

<p>Once you reach the refuge you can buy an array of food from sweets like Snickers and Mars bars to full meals. You can also buy bottled water but it is expensive because it has to be carried up by mule.</p>

<h2>Getting there</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get to Imlil from Marrakech is to take a Grand Taxi from the Taxi rank which can be found to the South West of the medina, outside Bab er Rob. The taxi rank is quite large but is further outside the medina than I had expected along a dusty road. Although more buildings have been built in the area now.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d13591.061720552316!2d-7.992708643123295!3d31.612886692871932!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x33f214a09ef67a41!2sStation+De+Taxis+Charij+Lbguer!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1398419080540" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe>


<p>On our way to the to the Taxi rank a minibus pulled up and we were asked if we were heading to Imlil, we agreed to pay 22 MAD (£1.60) each. An absolute bargain, but the minibus was a 12 seater and there were around 20 of us in it. When we arrived at Asni it got very confusing, we were ushered out of the minibus but we had no idea where we should be going. Luckily 3 teenagers who had been in the minibus directed us to a grand taxi. I shared the front passenger seat with Traci, the teenagers shared the back seat with another local couple. The smell of petrol was overpowering, even with all of the windows open. The journey from Asni to Imlil felt precarious along a roughish road, swerving around people selling fruit and trucks seemingly abandoned in the middle of road while they talked to people on the roadside. We were deposited at a taxi rank which is on the left side as you arrive in Imlil (open triangular area to the right of the road on the embedded map).</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m13!1m11!1m3!1d1005.790170907319!2d-7.920615930159965!3d31.137186968049317!2m2!1f0!2f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e1!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1398420469471" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe>


<p> If you planned to walk the route in a day you would need to stay in Imlil, unless you managed to arrive a lot earlier than we did. There were various places advertising rooms as we walked up the bank from the taxi rank. A search on Google will find several for around 200 MAD (£15) B&amp;B.</p>

<h2>The Walk</h2>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/DSCF1829.JPG" alt="Aroumd" />
We set off from Imlil after being dropped off at around 11:30. The village was very busy with vehicles, mules and people rushing around. I always find the hardest part of a walk navigationally is the start when leaving an unknown town or village.</p>

<p>I am always raring to set off and should take time to orientate yourself and map, I had taken the time at home to scan and geo-reference my paper map. so I now had a digital map on my phone which helped locate myself in Imlil and confirm I was indeed heading the direction I thought I was.</p>

<p>We found the track out of the village quite easily but found we had crossed the stream too early and were heading up to Aroumd (marked Around on the Cordee map) earlier than intended. This involved a steep climb through the trees but I could see we would join on to the same path. We walked through the edge of the village, passing a small group of children laughing and playing. As we walked by a small girl spat at me, I didn&#8217;t actually notice as she she was behind me. It appeared almost as if she had been dared to do it.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20092.JPG" alt="Flood plain" />
After leaving Aroumd behind there is a large rocky open area which looks like a flood plain but was bone dry when we walked. After the the flat stony expanse, you start the climb on a very obvious path. From here on the route is very easy to follow and you rarely need to consult the map, other than checking points off as you climb higher.</p>

<p>I would recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1873756771/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1873756771&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21">Moroccan Atlas Book</a> purely for the hand drawn maps. The Cordee map does not have the detail to help with the navigation out of Imlil, its the hand drawn maps that allowed me to see my route up to Aroumd would join onto the same track I had intended to take. After the climb from the flood plain, I never used the hand drawn maps again until I returned to the same point the next day.</p>

<p>The walking is quite easy, although a constant climb it&#8217;s on a track the mules travel daily up to the refuge. Your energy is sapped by the heat and once out of the trees near Imlil there is no escape from the sun. The temperature was in the high 30&#8217;s celsius with no let up all day.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20089.JPG" alt="Sidi Chamharouch" />
I don&#8217;t intend to write a detailed description of the walk up to the refuge, it&#8217;s too long ago and there are various books and websites which do a better job than I could. As we walked higher we did pass a few places that would be selling drinks and fruit, but they were closed maybe because it was now the middle of the day. They are just stalls or tiny stone buildings at the side of the track.</p>

<p>Some of these places are marked on the hand drawn maps in the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1873756771/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1873756771&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21">Moroccon Atlas book</a>. The last place you could actually find a proper place to buy drinks or take a rest is at Sidi Chamharouch, there were 2 places I spotted selling drinks and a few small places selling scarves and other items. The hamlet is built around a muslim shrine. You can see a large whitewashed rock as you pass. You cross over a bridge and again climb steeply. I can remember thinking the section above the hamlet must be the hardest part for the mules.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/DSCF1842.JPG" alt="Mules" />
Mules are the only way items can be brought to places above the flood plain we passed earlier, their destinations would be the 2 refuge higher up or Sidi Chamharouch. It&#8217;s amazing watching the array of items the mules are carrying from gas bottles to building supplies and of course food. We felt sorry for the mules often struggling up or down steep sections overburdened with supplies. Our walk up was surprisingly quiet, the higher we got the more people we saw heading in the opposite direction. Some of the mules were carrying people who were too lazy to walk or their luggage.  We also passed several groups who were being lead by guides.</p>

<p>There are lots of mention of guides when researching the walk up to Mt. Toubkal, I chose not to pay for one. There was honestly no need, the route is very easy to follow. In winter my advice would likely be different, unless you had plenty of experience. You will be bombarded with people back in Imlil asking if you want a guide. Clearly this is a source of employment for people in the area but in summer an experienced walker would not need one. If you do decide to pay for a guide be careful to get one who can clearly speak your language, many spoke French better than English.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20024.JPG" alt="Traci and the path" />
We made good progress keeping a slow but steady pace, we were beginning to wonder if we were ever going to reach the refuge. The water was running low and the blazing sun which was being shaded slightly by cloud now was still very strong. We were starting to feel more tired than expected, probably due to the heat and the altitude. As our energy started to sap the refuge came into view. We stopped to eat some of the bread we had taken from breakfast and drink some of our remaining water. Looking up there were still odd patches of snow in places clinging on in shaded areas above us. There were a few tents below the buildings, I was happy we hadn&#8217;t decided to camp up here.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20081.JPG" alt="Refuge" />
We were booked into the Les Mouflon de Toubkal, walking through the door at 16:30 we couldn&#8217;t see a thing until our eyes adjusted to the darkness.</p>

<p>There were a small number of people inside, some clearly who worked there. Most did not speak English and wore traditional clothes. This was in contrast to the person who appeared to be running the refuge who spoke perfect English and wore clothes like we would wear back home, T-shirt and jeans if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>We had booked 2 beds in a dorm but decided once we got there to change to a private room. We were pleased we did, there was a large number of older Japanese hikers staying who were very loud. We just wanted to relax and this would have been hard with the noise from the group. We were given some mint tea, which is very refreshing and is drank everywhere we went in Morocco.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20039.JPG" alt="Room in the refuge" />
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20037.JPG" alt="view from room" />
The room we were given was just off the open area and had a view back down the valley we had walked up. There were 2 single beds in the room with thick blankets. We had considered bringing sleeping bags, but instead brought just sleeping bag liners to protect us from any bed bugs, etc. I think this was a good idea, the blankets felt very itchy but cosy and warm.  We asked for an evening meal, I can&#8217;t remember if we had any choice but it was the best meal either of us had ever had. We think it was lamb tagine, but its possible it was goat. No matter what meat it was, Traci still states it was the best meal she has ever eaten. We had a large Tagine and bread to ourselves and would highly recommend doing this rather than carrying your own food up.</p>

<p>We arranged to have some breakfast ready for 6:30 the following day, then headed to bed to read and relax before going to sleep.</p>

<p>We had a very broken nights sleep due to strange loud noises all through the night, which sounded like tunneling beneath the refuge. This was the only negative thing about our stay there. They even had flushing toilets, unless I imagined that. We got up at 6:15 and our breakfast was already out for us with hot water for coffee brought once we sat at the table. Breakfast was jam and bread, we took some of the bread to eat during the day. We also bought 2 bottles of water and snickers before we left at 7:10.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20079.JPG" alt="view back to refuge" />
The path above the refuge crosses in front of a waterfall and steeply up a scree slope. We missed the track to the left which avoids the worst of the scree. Traci was struggling and was having problems with earache caused by the strong winds and possibly the altitude. She was also struggling to catch her breath and started telling me to do it on my own. We either did it together or we went down together.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20046.JPG" alt="boulders" />
We carried on and found a path marked by cairns. The wind was lighter in the gully and the sun hadn&#8217;t reached us yet due to the mountainsides. It was slow going, finding ourselves out of breath sooner than as UK heights. Traci was feeling it more than me, but I was happy to stop and catch my own breath. We worked our way up, we could see 2 hikers in the distance with the gap to them steadily decreasing. The path split into three at some point and we missed the initial split but stuck to the right where the scree was easier to cross.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20057.JPG" alt="Top of gully" />
A man travelling fast up towards us, soon caught us up. I&#8217;m not sure of his nationality, he may have been Moroccan but he spoke good English. Explaining it was his second time up having to return for pictures after his camera had been either lost or stolen. Soon after this we reached the top of the gully and the ridge where we turned left, continuing to follow the clear path. We passed the 2 hikers we had been closing in on, two women.</p>

<p>Shortly after passing the women we passed another 2 groups who were heading down. The first who were French, spoke to us in English telling us it was about 40 minutes to the top. Traci thought they were joking, thinking we were almost there. The group of 3 was British with a guide. The young lady looked ina bad way, clearly struggling and in tears. The guide was helping her down as best he could.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20061.JPG" alt="summit in view" />
A couple of minutes after this the summit came into view but the track went to the left of the ridge before heading to the right and the summit. It took around 20 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20073.JPG" alt="Summit of Mt Toubkal" />
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/DSCF1871.JPG" alt="us on the summit" />
We met the guy at the top who had lost his pictures on his previous trip. We took pictures for each other before he left us alone at the summit. After around 20 minutes we decided to head back down as we were leaving the two ladies we past earlier had arrived and asked us to take pictures for them.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/marrakech/Marrakech%20095.JPG" alt="Nearly back to Imlil" />
We descended fast retracing our path, which was more obvious on the descent. We didn&#8217;t hang around when we reached the refuge but continued on. We stopped to eat some of our bread below the refuge, it took less than 2 hours from the refuge to Sidi Chamharouch and the white rock which we passed quickly. There were a lot less people on our return journey.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later and we were at the zigzags above the flood plain. I decided to ignore the route description and head the more obvious route which was far easier and faster.</p>

<p>We arrived in Imlil just before 4pm and bartered for a grand taxi back to Marrakech for 200 MAD (£15), although I also had to pay the guy I was bartering with not the driver. The smallest amount I had was 50 MAD (£3.66). We had the taxi to ourselves this time, although the driver was crazy, driving very fast, over taking vehicles with cars heading towards us. He had to go onto the dirt at the side of the road to avoid collisions on more than one occasion. We were pleased when we made it back to Bab er Rob and the Taxi rank in one piece.</p>

<p>I was conscious that we could make the last free shuttle bus of the day back to our hotel if we were fast. I set off at pace for the pickup point, but Traci was struggling to keep up. We made it to the shuttle bus with a minute to spare before it arrived.</p>

<p>We both loved the walk and Morocco, we returned the following year for a more relaxing holiday. I would highly recommend Marrakech and the walk up Mt. Toubkal.</p>

<p>You can find the zipped GPX track for the 2 days <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/files/Toubkal.zip">here</a>, which could help with timings and the actual route we took.</p>

<p>The most successful projects, to me at least, are those where you learn so much more than you ever expected to. I started the Peak Visibility project to find the answer to what seamed like a very simple question &#8220;Which Scottish Mountain can you see the most?&#8221;. You can find out how this question arose in the <a href="http://stevenhorner.com/blog/2013/08/30/the-most-visible-mountain-in-scotland/" title="First Peak Visiblity Post">first Peak Visibility post</a> or at the end of this post.</p>

<p>It was not quite as simple as I had thought, the first thing was to define the question more specifically.</p>

<p>I decided to limit my criteria to Munro (mountains in Scotland over 3000 feet), this reduced the list considerably down to 282 mountains at the current count. I then set the criteria, which I defined as &#8220;If I stood on the highest point of the mountain (summit) what land would be visible&#8221;, this would give me the answer &#8220;Which summits could I see from any point in Scotland&#8221;. I also decided I could also work out &#8220;If I stood on a Munro summit which other summits could I see&#8221;.</p>

<p>The table above may be different to many would have expected, yes Ben Nevis and Ben Macdui are in there. When you actually think about it they both have some very large neighbours which block the view. Both also have quite large summit plateaus. For a view on Ben Nevis I have always walked away from the summit, close to the edge. I am still waiting to see anything though after 7 cloudy summit visits.</p>

<p>The top 2 Stob Binnein and Ben More are next to each other and are often tackled in a <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/ben-more.shtml" title="Stob Binnein &amp; Ben More walk">single day walk</a>. There are not too many other high mountains within the immediate vicinity. If you ignore the few Munro to the South West, the next closest Munro is 5 miles away (Sgiath Chuil) and is quite low.</p>

<p>Compare that to Ben Macdui which has Braeriach and Cairn Gorm very close along with a host of other Munro in all directions, these block the viewability yet Ben Macdui still manages position number 4.</p>

<p>The Visible Area column of the 2 tables above show the number of square Kilometres the summits can be viewed from (or be seen from). The higher the number the larger the area it can be seen from. Something to note, these figures are on land only. I masked the sea, but does includes visibility from land locked lochs.</p>

<h2>Highest number of visible Munro</h2>

<p>I mentioned that I could work out which other Munro you could see from the top of each Munro. Looking at the data this way gives a different list.</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>


<p>There are a few similar names in the list, Ben Macdui, Ben Nevis and Ben Lawers but Geal-charn?</p>

<p>I will be honest that I had never heard of Geal-charn yet there are actually 4 Munros with the same name, 2 &#8220;Geal-charn&#8221; and 2 spelt &#8220;Geal charn&#8221; without the hyphen. The one in the table above is North West of Ben Alder at grid ref NN469746. This almost topped the list, until I re-ran the data in newer software it was relegated to Number 2.</p>

<h2>New Classifications</h2>

<p>For a bit of fun I decided that from the data I have produced I would create 2 new Classifications like Munro, Marilyns, Wainwrights etc. The new ones are Horners and Tracis.</p>

<h3>Mountains Classified as Horners</h3>

<div><script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/master/Horners/Horners.geojson"></script></div>


<p>A mountain summit which can be viewed from 1000 square Kilometres excluding from the sea. There are currently 112 Horners and if you have completed the Munros then you have done them. This will change though and will expand to include all of Great Britain (Scotland, England and Wales).</p>

<p>Why create more classifications, becuase many of us like lists and these are slightly different to the thers which are normally based on height and/or drop.</p>

<p>You can download the list of Horners below, this list can easily be linked to The Database of British and Irish Hills by using the Number column (it is their number).</p>

<p>Download the Horners in the following formats: <a href="https://raw.github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/master/Horners/Horners.csv" title="Horners CSV">CSV</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/blob/master/Horners/Horners.zip?raw=true" title="Horners Shapefile">SHP</a>, <a href="https://raw.github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/master/Horners/Horners.geojson" title="Horners geojson">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<h3>Mountains Classified as Tracis</h3>

<div><script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/master/Tracis/Tracis.geojson"></script></div>


<p>A 3000 foot mountain summit where you can view at least 100 other 3000 foot mountain summits. There are currently 75 Tracis all in Scotland. It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to work out that there will be none in England or Wales because there aren&#8217;t enough mountains over 3000 feet there to make the grade unless you can see enough of the Scottish Munro from the Skiddaw.</p>

<p>Why call these Tracis, they are named after my long suffering Girlfriend who has had to put up with me working for weeks/months on the Peak Visibility Project often late into the night while she is trying to sleep with me randomly talking to myself working out heights, distances, projections and various other related stuff. The Tracis are also something special just like her, oh and she will likely have to put up with me dragging her up all of them.</p>

<p>You can download the list of Tracis below, this list can easily be linked to The Database of British and Irish Hills by using the Number column (it is their number).</p>

<p>Download the Tracis in the following formats: <a href="https://raw.github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/master/Tracis/Tracis.csv" title="Tracis CSV">CSV</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/blob/master/Tracis/Tracis(shp).zip?raw=true" title="Tracis shapefile">SHP</a>, <a href="https://raw.github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/master/Tracis/Tracis.geojson" title="Tracis geojson">GeoJSON</a>.</p>

<h2>Schiehallion?</h2>

<p>So what happened to Schiehallion?</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/schiehallion.png" alt="Schiehallion rank" /></p>

<p>Schiehallion is down there in position number 83 on Visibility. Something to be aware of is that the whole data is worked out on the visibility of the actual summit. If you have ever walked up Ben Nevis via the tourist route you will know you can&#8217;t see the summit until near the end of the walk. The summit is completely hidden by the mass of the mountain. So thinking about it a mountain that is pointy, quite high and not surrounded by too many high mountains should rank highly.</p>

<h2>Errors, thanks and stuff</h2>

<p>I will start by saying I am confident this data is not 100% accurate. Much like the Munro tables were not accurate and have been gradually updated over the years, so will the Peak Visibility Project along with the Horner and Traci classifications.
I will go into more detail over on the <a href="https://github.com/stevenhorner/PeakVisibility/" title="Peak Visibility Project on Github">Peak Visibility Github page</a> over the coming weeks, where you can also find much of the raw data and results but I&#8217;m going to take a little break from it, so don&#8217;t expect to to see full explanations in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>I Would like to thank Michael Spencer (<a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/" title="Scottishsnow">Scottishsnow</a>) for a few helpful pointers early on in the process and his <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">Caleb&#8217;s List post</a> which gave me the spark I needed. His site is well worth following. I also need to thank or blame <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilOutdoors" title="Phil Turner">Phil Turner</a> who if he reads this will probably wonder why, he pointed out Schiehallion one winter while walking from Bridge of Orchy to Kinlochleven and mentioned it being one of the most visible mountains, that stuck.</p>

<p>I mentioned at the start that the most sucessful projects are those where you learn, in the course of this project I have worked with Virtualization, Ubuntu server, Ubuntu Desktop, QGIS (1.8, 2.0.1, 2.1.0), GDAL, GRASS, python, projections and a multitude of other stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed the process.</p>

<p>To produce the data and results I have used a variety of data from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/ML2.JPG" alt="Training in Lake District" />Over a year ago now I attended a Mountain Leader Summer Training course with the intention of deciding if I would like to guide walks for a living. I had taken many friends and family walking over the years and wanted to know what it would be like to do it for a job.</p>

<p>If I decided not to follow that ML path the money (£450) wouldn&#8217;t be wasted because I knew I would gain new skills which I&#8217;m always eager to learn. I originally hoped to do the course at <a href="http://www.glenmorelodge.org.uk/" title="Glenmore Lodge">Glenmore Lodge</a>, having heard good things from others who had attended. Unfortunately they were fully booked, my next choice would be in the Lake District.</p>

<p>Top of the list was <a href="http://www.mountainleadercourses.co.uk/" title="Apex Training">Apex</a> not just because they begin with A, but because the prices were competitive, included accommodation in <a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/coniston-holly-how" title="Holly How Youth Hostel">Holly How Youth Hostel</a> where I had stayed before and they had good feedback on their courses.
Upon arrival at the Youth Hostel I checked in and waited for the others to arrive. The other attendees had a range of backgrounds and reasons for attending. I was surprised that some had never wildcamped a night in their lives.</p>

<h3>Entry Requirements</h3>

<p>To attend a <a href="http://www.mountain-training.org/default.aspx" title="Mountain Training">Mountain Leader</a> course you are supposed to have a minimum of 20 Quality mountain days, be registered with the <a href="http://www.mountain-training.org/default.aspx" title="Mountain Training">Mountain Training Association</a> in your country and have a log book completed to show that you have this experience.
I had typed my log book up and had over 40 quality mountain days from all over the UK, this was only a fraction of the quality days I could have actually entered.
Not everyone else was this organised or experienced, some had not completed the log book at all. Some clearly didn&#8217;t have anywhere near that level of experience.
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/ML4.jpg" alt="Log Book" /></p>

<h3>Numbers and Reasons</h3>

<p>There were 5 of us who arrived for the course on the Sunday evening, also Marc from <a href="http://www.passandpeak.com/" title="Pass and Peak">Pass and Peak</a> who is a qualified Mountain Leader tagged along to keep his hand in and helped out for the first few days. We were joined on the Tuesday by Dean from <a href="http://www.activeedge.co.uk/" title="Active Edge">Active Edge</a> who I had more in common with (not paragliding) but I will get to that shortly.</p>

<p>I already mentioned my reasons for attending but the other attendees generally had different reasons. Two were from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Glasgow-Walking-and-Hillwalking-Club/" title="Glasgow Walking and Hillwalking club">Glasgow hill walking club</a> and they wanted to learn skills to help with the group walks they did. Another attendee worked for the scouts, but was more of a climber. There was only one who was really doing the course for the mountain leader qualification so he could use that as part of his business as a paraglider teacher, this was Dean who joined us on the second day after having started a course previously and breaking an ankle.
There was 3 males and 3 females which I think is unusual, generally I believe the males outnumber the women.</p>

<h3>What do you learn?</h3>

<p>Below is a overview of the things we covered in my course, I can&#8217;t guarantee I got this in correct order, it was over a year since my course.</p>

<h4>Weather Forecasting</h4>

<p>The weather reading was really interesting and I learned a lot, I understood what an isobar was before the course but not much more. Each evening we spent time studying the next few days weather charts and making our predictions. We would also review what we had predicted for the previous day. This could sound dull to some, but I really enjoyed this and I now read the synoptic charts myself before heading to the hills as well as checking what <a href="http://www.mwis.org.uk/" title="Mountain Weather Information Service">MWIS</a> say.</p>

<h4>Navigation</h4>

<p>The first full day started with finding out our natural pacing by walking 100m and seeing how many steps it took. We then did compass work and map reading with lots of practise. While I could read a map well and had basic compass skills, this highlighted I needed more practise. We were each taught about a different plant that we would then have to point out to the others and explain more about it. The day finished back at the Youth Hostel with predicting the weather and reviewing our previous predictions.
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/ML1.JPG" alt="Practising" /></p>

<h4>Rope Work</h4>

<p>The second day was Rope work and steep ground, we also practised map and compass work. The rope work was another area I was keen to learn in, while I climbed indoors the techniques used on the Mountain Leader training is very different. We had fun trying out the different knots, altough you can get away with only one. You learn everything you need to lower someone down rock faces with only a rope and no other climbing equipment (we had helmets). Besides for the brushing up my map reading skills this was the most enjoyable part of the week. Again the day ends with the weather for the coming days and review.</p>

<h4>Rope practise &amp; Trip planning</h4>

<p>Day three we practised steep ground and crossed loose shale, again map and compass work. We then put our new skills from the rope lessons the day before to practise by setting up everything ourselves with the instructor checking just before we lowered each other. We then headed back to the Youth Hostel to do some planning work, this involved planning a trip for groups as if we were qualified mountain leaders. We would have to take into account the ability of the people we were given, the weather, the area, the desires of the group and a lot more. This was actually easier for me than the others because I knew the Lake District far better than the others but I don&#8217;t really like doing this. Again we finished with the weather.</p>

<h4>Overnighter</h4>

<p>Day four is the day we would be setting off for our overnighter, obviously to me this is nothing new but for several of the others this was a huge deal. One had never done a wildcamp before and it looked like from the size of her pack that she had brought the entire contents of her house. A slight exageration, I&#8217;m not sure she had practised pitching the tent she had borrowed either. Yes I took the Trailstar, you can imagine the others faces when I described it. Yet it wasn&#8217;t the only one in our group, Dean also had a Trailstar and had read my review and pitching guide for it. I wonder how often 2 Trailstars had been used on an ML course at that point.</p>

<p>The weather was poor when we headed out, I don&#8217;t think it stopped raining all day. We spent the day taking turns navigating the rest of the group to the locations we were given. You learn a lot more than just navigating but taking into account the groups abilities and pacing rather than racing off. After a wet day navigating we pitched our shelters, the instructor was keen to look at the Trailstar and was happy with it. I think he had visions of me and Dean having to share his tent with us. We then practised river crossings not in the river because it was in flood. A few hours rest before we had to get up for night nav.</p>

<h4>Night Nav</h4>

<p>This was another part of the course I was looking forward to, when we emerged from our shelters not only was it dark but the fog had descended and we could only see a few feet ahead of us. Perfect weather for really learning. We may as well have been blind folded the visibility was so poor, yet the rain had stopped. The streams were flooded and we had several to cross. I think all of us enjoyed the night nav, it&#8217;s the perfect way to put all skills learned earlier in the week to practise.</p>

<p>The final day we walked back to our pickup location which was at the Old Dungeeon Ghyll. We then returned to the Youth Hostel where we were individually debriefed by our instructor.</p>

<h4>Debrief</h4>

<p>The instructor was very happy with me over the week and with my levels of experience and knowledge. I didn&#8217;t have much I needed to work on, he commented on the depth of experience I already had. He did comment on footwear because during the week I had discussed my dislike for boots which I had worn all week. He said they had passed people with Trailrunners but while that might be fine for the guide, if you were actually leading you would probably want to wear boots so that your clients who have less or no experience wear boots that they should be safer in. He wore trailrunners when not working.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>While training to become a Summer Mountain Leader there are a couple of useful books that are worth reading:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0954151100/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0954151100&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21" title="Hill Walking: The Official Handbook of the Mountain Leader and Walking Group Leader Schemes">Hill Walking: The Official Handbook of the Mountain Leader and Walking Group Leader Schemes</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0907521932/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0907521932&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21" title="Hostile Habitats">Hostile Habitats</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The above are essential reading even if you have no interest in leading. The following 2 books are useful if you decide to go for the Winter Mountain leader or one of the climbing awards.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0954151135/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0954151135&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=faitocom-21" title="Winter Skills: Essential Walking and Climbing Techniques">Winter Skills: Essential Walking and Climbing Techniques</a></li>

</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I loved it, the people in my group had a wide variety of skill levels but all were there to learn and no one dropped out. I decided not to persue a career Leading. I will continue to take friends and family out walking but I would hate the planning side that I would need to do if taking paying customers, which is strange considering how much I love maps. I would just prefer not to have the hassle, I go walking to get away from things not to take more potential problems with me.</p>

<p>While we were doing the Mountain Leader Training there was was an Assessment course running at the same time. It was interesting to talk to them and It was obvious to me some of them didn&#8217;t have the skills to be a leader. Only 1 passed out 5.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend going on the course even if you have no intention of taking the assessment and becoming a leader. The skills you will learn and refine during the week are worth every penny.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I forgot to take many pictures during the course and the ones I did take are very poor quality. Sorry about that.</p>

<h4>Be aware that there have been changes to the course since I attended, the rope work has changed considerably. <a href="http://www.mountain-training.org/latest-news/mountain-leader-summer-award-updates" title="Changes to Summer Mountain Leader Training">Please read this</a>.</h4>

<p>On a recent trip to the West Highlands I pointed out what I believed to be Schiehallion in the distance as we crossed Rannoch Moor in the car. I recalled how I had been told it was the mountain you could see from the most places in Scotland.
I decided that I would test if this was really true. I had a feeling it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<h3>How do you do that?</h3>

<p>Obviously I am not going to stand in every spot in Scotland and work out what mountains I can see, I would need several life times. Instead I will use <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS (QGIS)</a> on a computer along with elevation data and a handy plugin or 2. I had recently read <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRSpencer" title="Michael Spencer on Twitter">Michael Spencers</a> <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">blog post</a> regarding <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">Caleb&#8217;s List</a> which gave some helpful information, have a look at what it <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">viewable from Arthurs Seat</a>.</p>

<h3>This could take a long time&#8230;</h3>

<p>I said I would need several life times to do this without a computer, but even using a standard computer it takes a long time. I worked out how far to the horizon and I would work out my calcuation based on seeing the top of the mountain, or more accurately someone stood on the top.
My first run with the full data took 2.5 days just to work out where in Scotland you could view someone stood on the top of Schiehallion. When I looked at the data annoyingly it hadn&#8217;t done it correctly and half of the data was missing. Here&#8217;s what was produced.
Remember I wanted to find out which mountain was the most visible in Scotland, within my criteria which you can read in the Additional Technical Details further down this post. I decided to limit the mountains to only Munros initially, this would mean that I have to run the same process that I tried on Schiehallion for each Munro.</p>

<pre><code>2.5 days * 282 Munros = A long time (705 days)
</code></pre>

<p>I am not the most patient person, 2015 for an answer is more than I am willing to wait.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html" title="OS Boundary-Line">OS Boundry-line</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Extra data needed for calculation:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Calculated horizon: 90 miles (from Ben Nevis)</li>
<li>Limit to only the 282 Munros</li>
</ul>


<p>The software used was <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS (QGIS)</a>, I tried both the <a href="http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed" title="QGIS Visibility Analysis">QGIS Visibility Analysis plugin</a> and the <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">GRASS Line of Sight (r.los) module</a> within the Sextante plugin.</p>

<p>The Terrain data is <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/terrain-50.html" title="OS Terrain 50">OS Terrain 50</a> Grid which I merged together to produce one large terrain TIF for Scotland, I then clipped this using the Scottish boundary (probably didn&#8217;t need to do this).</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.boatsafe.com/tools/horizon.htm" title="Boatsafe Horizon Calculator">Boatsafe website</a> to calculate the horizon. This is different depending on your height, if you are stood on the top of Ben Nevis obviously you can see further than if you were at sea level. I decided to use 2 metres above the height of Ben Nevis, 1346m for all mountains. This calculated that the horizon would be just under 90 miles away, which I rounded up to 90. In reality the chances of actually being able to see that far are almost zero.</p>

<p>I also decided that I would use the following scenario, that if someone stood on the top of a mountain could they be seen within 90 miles without the direct line of sight being blocked by other hills. I have no way to calcuate trees or man made structures blocking the view and this would only increase the time taken to calculate.</p>

<p>The QGIS Visibility Analysis took 2.5 days to complete on my Core i5 3.2Ghz with 8GB RAM machine. Annoying <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">QGIS</a> is only a 32 bit program and only uses a single core rather than the 4 available. For some reason it didn&#8217;t complete correctly, but even with half of the results it was still interesting to see how far away Schiehallion can potentially be seen.</p>

<p>I decided to try the <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">GRASS line of sight (r.los) module</a> in the <a href="http://sextantegis.com/" title="Sextante">Sextante plugin</a>. I have found GRASS to be faster in the past than some of the built-in functions. This time I ran a test with a 25 mile view and this completed in 10 minutes.
Running the full 90 mile range in GRASS took 20 hours, the image at the top of this post is the returned data overlaid on Google Terrain.</p>

<p>To complete this using <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">r.los</a> is still going to take 235 days, unless I can build a multi-threaded version of QGIS (<a href="http://faunaliagis.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/qgis-64bit-for-windows-is-ready-to-test/" title="64bit QGIS">64 bit test version</a>, not mulithreaded just released). This isn&#8217;t planned until at least version 2.1, 2.0 is the next release. In the interim I will test with different viewable distances to find an acceptable processing time. The full 90 miles is further than anyone realistically could ever see anyway.</p>

<p>Once each mountains visibility is calculated, I convert the raster output to vector, crop using the Scottish Boundary-line data (removes visility at sea) then calculate the total area. This gives an easy figure to compare between each mountain. This figure could then be given as a percentage of the total area of Scotland eg.</p>

<pre><code>Schiehallion is visible from 0.0105% of Scotland.
</code></pre>

<p>I have also ran the above for Ben Nevis which can be seen below</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevis_Viewable.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis Viewshed" /></p>

<pre><code>Ben Nevis is visible from 0.0151% of Scotland
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see if the above is correct Ben Nevis is viewable from a larger percentage of Scotland. I think other mountains maybe more visible than Ben Nevis.</p>

<h3>The Most Visible Mountains (So far)..</h3>

<ol>
<li>Ben Nevis (0.0151%)</li>
<li>Schiehallion (0.0105%)</li>
<li>TBC&#8230;</li>
</ol>


<h3>Fixes</h3>

<p>After generating the Ben Nevis and Schiehallion data I realised a couple of potential errors. I had calculated the Horizon from the top of Ben Nevis and used this for Schiehallion too, 261m higher than it actually is although this wouldn&#8217;t actually alter the end results (Schiehallions height is used for the calcuation). Originally I used the <a href="http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed" title="QGIS Visibility Analysis">QGIS visibility plugin</a> which doesn&#8217;t allow for the Earth&#8217;s curvature (I don&#8217;t think), <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">r.los</a> does allow me to choose this. I will re-run both Schiehallion and Ben Nevis without limiting the viewable range and enable the Earths curvature.</p>

<p>Ben Dolphin (<a href="https://twitter.com/CountrysideBen" title="Ben Dolphin">@CountrysideBen</a>) pointed out an excellent site <a href="http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas.html" title="Panoramas">Panoramas</a> where you can view and download computer generated Panoramas of many mountains around the world, including Scotland. They are fantastic and happily the Ben Nevis ones look very close to my findings.</p>

<h3>Help and suggestions</h3>

<p>I am not a mathematician, geographer, cartographer or scientist just someone who loves mountains, maps and computers. I would be very surprised if I haven&#8217;t made many mistakes in my calculations. If you are aware of any, please let me know or if you can provide any help. I find it fascinating and hope others do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMCycle1.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis OpenCycleMap" />
Following on from my <a href="http://stevenhorner.com/blog/2013/08/18/map-subscription-service/" title="StevenHorner.com - Map Subscription Service">previous post</a> and the desire for an official map subscription service, I mentioned if the established map providers don&#8217;t do something radical soon they will start to lose business among the regular public.
The biggest threat to traditional mapping agencies like <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> or <a href="http://www.ign.fr/" title="IGN">IGN</a> I believe will come from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> based maps. Several years ago I remember seeing <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/" title="OpenCycleMap">OpenCycleMap</a> with it&#8217;s contour lines and relief shading which look very similar to <a href="http://www.harveymaps.co.uk/" title="Harvey Maps">Harvey maps</a>. The problem with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> at the moment depending on the area you are looking at is the holes in the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMLandscape1.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis Thunderforest Landcape Map" /></p>

<h3>Holes in the data?</h3>

<p>Although <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> started in the UK it is a truely worldwide map. In many less developed countries and many developed ones too, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> is far more accurate and complete than any other map available. Yet if you look at many areas in the UK, things are missing. To use for walking purposes the standard Mapnik layer isn&#8217;t much good unless you are navigating towns and villages.
If you want to walk in the hills you need contours, those orange swirly lines on <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps. I said above the <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/" title="OpenCycleMap">OpenCycleMap</a> caught my eye, it is basically just the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> data styled differently with contours and relief shading added. There are other syles available that also offer Contours like Thunderforest Outdoors or Thunderforest Landscape. These omit much of the data from the standard map that you don&#8217;t need for outdoor activities but keep things like pubs and toilets.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMOutdoors1.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis ThunderForest Outdoors Map" /></p>

<h3>Dangerous</h3>

<p>You would think that the Outdoors style would be the one to go for, but take a look at Ben Nevis. It has contours but those contours are STRM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) ones that dont&#8217; show the vertical drop if you wandered too far from the summit. They only show contours every 90m in the UK, 30m in the USA. In fact it doesn&#8217;t look a bad descent.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMB006.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis Summit ThunderForest Landscape Map" /></p>

<p>Take a look at the Landscape style and it adds the vertical drop marked with the solid black line, much like Harvey maps show. Although still those contours are used that just aren&#8217;t detailed enough. There are areas where the contours don&#8217;t join up correctly either. Also the Outdoors map oddly omits walls, which I always find help greatly with navigation.
I&#8217;m not exactly selling <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> for walking if it&#8217;s missing potentially lethal vertical drops. The beauty of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OSM</a> is you can use the data and style it in anyway you like and add other data to create a totally unique map that has the details YOU want.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMB002.jpg" alt="OS OpenData Terrain 50 - Ben Nevis Contours" /></p>

<h3>What data is available</h3>

<p>If you live in the UK <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> have released some &#8220;OpenData&#8221; which you can use. They actually released several complete maps but none of these are ideal for walking, they kept the Crown Jewels (Explorer &amp; Landranger). The products that are usefull to supplement <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/terrain-50.html" title="OS OpenData Terrain 50">OS Terrain 50</a> (replacing LAND-FORM Panorama)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html" title="OS VectorMap District">VectorMap District</a></li>
</ul>


<p>VectorMap district is actually an entire map product but we can borrow only the bits we need.
There are a lot of other sources of data out there for the UK and overseas. <a href="http://www.gis.naturalengland.org.uk/pubs/gis/GIS_register.asp" title="Natural England Data sets">Natural England</a> provide Open Access land data, so you could re-create those shaded orange areas. They provide a lot other data too but most is not needed on a walking map.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMB003.jpg" alt="Bodged together Map" /></p>

<h3>So what can we create?</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s a very quick bodged together map just to see what this data looks like, you can see it&#8217;s bodged together because it&#8217;s not layered correctly and it looks to be honest horrendous, but you can see if it was styled, it would have everything we need. Ths was created in a couple of minutes using <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS( QGIS)</a>, to do this properly and produce a usable map at the end I prefer other tools. In the next post I will explain how to create a usable Outdoors maps using the data mentioned above.</p>
