  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/Schiehallion_viewshed.jpg" alt="Schiehallion Viewshed" /></p>

<p>On a recent trip to the West Highlands I pointed out what I believed to be Schiehallion in the distance as we crossed Rannoch Moor in the car. I recalled how I had been told it was the mountain you could see from the most places in Scotland.
I decided that I would test if this was really true. I had a feeling it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<h3>How do you do that?</h3>

<p>Obviously I am not going to stand in every spot in Scotland and work out what mountains I can see, I would need several life times. Instead I will use <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS (QGIS)</a> on a computer along with elevation data and a handy plugin or 2. I had recently read <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRSpencer" title="Michael Spencer on Twitter">Michael Spencers</a> <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">blog post</a> regarding <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">Caleb&#8217;s List</a> which gave some helpful information, have a look at what it <a href="http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/caleb-arthurs/" title="Caleb's List">viewable from Arthurs Seat</a>.</p>

<h3>This could take a long time&#8230;</h3>

<p>I said I would need several life times to do this without a computer, but even using a standard computer it takes a long time. I worked out how far to the horizon and I would work out my calcuation based on seeing the top of the mountain, or more accurately someone stood on the top.
My first run with the full data took 2.5 days just to work out where in Scotland you could view someone stood on the top of Schiehallion. When I looked at the data annoyingly it hadn&#8217;t done it correctly and half of the data was missing. Here&#8217;s what was produced.
Remember I wanted to find out which mountain was the most visible in Scotland, within my criteria which you can read in the Additional Technical Details further down this post. I decided to limit the mountains to only Munros initially, this would mean that I have to run the same process that I tried on Schiehallion for each Munro.</p>

<pre><code>2.5 days * 282 Munros = A long time (705 days)
</code></pre>

<p>I am not the most patient person, 2015 for an answer is more than I am willing to wait.</p>

<h3>Additional Technical Details</h3>

<li><a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">r.los GRASS module</a></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html" title="OS Boundary-Line">OS Boundry-line</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Extra data needed for calculation:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Calculated horizon: 90 miles (from Ben Nevis)</li>
<li>Limit to only the 282 Munros</li>
</ul>


<p>The software used was <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS (QGIS)</a>, I tried both the <a href="http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed" title="QGIS Visibility Analysis">QGIS Visibility Analysis plugin</a> and the <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">GRASS Line of Sight (r.los) module</a> within the Sextante plugin.</p>

<p>The Terrain data is <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/terrain-50.html" title="OS Terrain 50">OS Terrain 50</a> Grid which I merged together to produce one large terrain TIF for Scotland, I then clipped this using the Scottish boundary (probably didn&#8217;t need to do this).</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.boatsafe.com/tools/horizon.htm" title="Boatsafe Horizon Calculator">Boatsafe website</a> to calculate the horizon. This is different depending on your height, if you are stood on the top of Ben Nevis obviously you can see further than if you were at sea level. I decided to use 2 metres above the height of Ben Nevis, 1346m for all mountains. This calculated that the horizon would be just under 90 miles away, which I rounded up to 90. In reality the chances of actually being able to see that far are almost zero.</p>

<p>I also decided that I would use the following scenario, that if someone stood on the top of a mountain could they be seen within 90 miles without the direct line of sight being blocked by other hills. I have no way to calcuate trees or man made structures blocking the view and this would only increase the time taken to calculate.</p>

<p>The QGIS Visibility Analysis took 2.5 days to complete on my Core i5 3.2Ghz with 8GB RAM machine. Annoying <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">QGIS</a> is only a 32 bit program and only uses a single core rather than the 4 available. For some reason it didn&#8217;t complete correctly, but even with half of the results it was still interesting to see how far away Schiehallion can potentially be seen.</p>

<p>I decided to try the <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">GRASS line of sight (r.los) module</a> in the <a href="http://sextantegis.com/" title="Sextante">Sextante plugin</a>. I have found GRASS to be faster in the past than some of the built-in functions. This time I ran a test with a 25 mile view and this completed in 10 minutes.
Running the full 90 mile range in GRASS took 20 hours, the image at the top of this post is the returned data overlaid on Google Terrain.</p>

<p>To complete this using <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">r.los</a> is still going to take 235 days, unless I can build a multi-threaded version of QGIS (<a href="http://faunaliagis.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/qgis-64bit-for-windows-is-ready-to-test/" title="64bit QGIS">64 bit test version</a>, not mulithreaded just released). This isn&#8217;t planned until at least version 2.1, 2.0 is the next release. In the interim I will test with different viewable distances to find an acceptable processing time. The full 90 miles is further than anyone realistically could ever see anyway.</p>

<p>Once each mountains visibility is calculated, I convert the raster output to vector, crop using the Scottish Boundary-line data (removes visility at sea) then calculate the total area. This gives an easy figure to compare between each mountain. This figure could then be given as a percentage of the total area of Scotland eg.</p>

<pre><code>Schiehallion is visible from 0.0105% of Scotland.
</code></pre>

<p>I have also ran the above for Ben Nevis which can be seen below</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevis_Viewable.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis Viewshed" /></p>

<pre><code>Ben Nevis is visible from 0.0151% of Scotland
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see if the above is correct Ben Nevis is viewable from a larger percentage of Scotland. I think other mountains maybe more visible than Ben Nevis.</p>

<h3>The Most Visible Mountains (So far)..</h3>

<ol>
<li>Ben Nevis (0.0151%)</li>
<li>Schiehallion (0.0105%)</li>
<li>TBC&#8230;</li>
</ol>


<h3>Fixes</h3>

<p>After generating the Ben Nevis and Schiehallion data I realised a couple of potential errors. I had calculated the Horizon from the top of Ben Nevis and used this for Schiehallion too, 261m higher than it actually is although this wouldn&#8217;t actually alter the end results (Schiehallions height is used for the calcuation). Originally I used the <a href="http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed" title="QGIS Visibility Analysis">QGIS visibility plugin</a> which doesn&#8217;t allow for the Earth&#8217;s curvature (I don&#8217;t think), <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/r.los.html" title="r.los GRASS module">r.los</a> does allow me to choose this. I will re-run both Schiehallion and Ben Nevis without limiting the viewable range and enable the Earths curvature.</p>

<p>Ben Dolphin (<a href="https://twitter.com/CountrysideBen" title="Ben Dolphin">@CountrysideBen</a>) pointed out an excellent site <a href="http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas.html" title="Panoramas">Panoramas</a> where you can view and download computer generated Panoramas of many mountains around the world, including Scotland. They are fantastic and happily the Ben Nevis ones look very close to my findings.</p>

<h3>Help and suggestions</h3>

<p>I am not a mathematician, geographer, cartographer or scientist just someone who loves mountains, maps and computers. I would be very surprised if I haven&#8217;t made many mistakes in my calculations. If you are aware of any, please let me know or if you can provide any help. I find it fascinating and hope others do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMCycle1.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis OpenCycleMap" />
Following on from my <a href="http://stevenhorner.com/blog/2013/08/18/map-subscription-service/" title="StevenHorner.com - Map Subscription Service">previous post</a> and the desire for an official map subscription service, I mentioned if the established map providers don&#8217;t do something radical soon they will start to lose business among the regular public.
The biggest threat to traditional mapping agencies like <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> or <a href="http://www.ign.fr/" title="IGN">IGN</a> I believe will come from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> based maps. Several years ago I remember seeing <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/" title="OpenCycleMap">OpenCycleMap</a> with it&#8217;s contour lines and relief shading which look very similar to <a href="http://www.harveymaps.co.uk/" title="Harvey Maps">Harvey maps</a>. The problem with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> at the moment depending on the area you are looking at is the holes in the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMLandscape1.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis Thunderforest Landcape Map" /></p>

<h3>Holes in the data?</h3>

<p>Although <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> started in the UK it is a truely worldwide map. In many less developed countries and many developed ones too, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> is far more accurate and complete than any other map available. Yet if you look at many areas in the UK, things are missing. To use for walking purposes the standard Mapnik layer isn&#8217;t much good unless you are navigating towns and villages.
If you want to walk in the hills you need contours, those orange swirly lines on <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps. I said above the <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/" title="OpenCycleMap">OpenCycleMap</a> caught my eye, it is basically just the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> data styled differently with contours and relief shading added. There are other syles available that also offer Contours like Thunderforest Outdoors or Thunderforest Landscape. These omit much of the data from the standard map that you don&#8217;t need for outdoor activities but keep things like pubs and toilets.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMOutdoors1.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis ThunderForest Outdoors Map" /></p>

<h3>Dangerous</h3>

<p>You would think that the Outdoors style would be the one to go for, but take a look at Ben Nevis. It has contours but those contours are STRM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) ones that dont&#8217; show the vertical drop if you wandered too far from the summit. They only show contours every 90m in the UK, 30m in the USA. In fact it doesn&#8217;t look a bad descent.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMB006.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis Summit ThunderForest Landscape Map" /></p>

<p>Take a look at the Landscape style and it adds the vertical drop marked with the solid black line, much like Harvey maps show. Although still those contours are used that just aren&#8217;t detailed enough. There are areas where the contours don&#8217;t join up correctly either. Also the Outdoors map oddly omits walls, which I always find help greatly with navigation.
I&#8217;m not exactly selling <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> for walking if it&#8217;s missing potentially lethal vertical drops. The beauty of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OSM</a> is you can use the data and style it in anyway you like and add other data to create a totally unique map that has the details YOU want.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMB002.jpg" alt="OS OpenData Terrain 50 - Ben Nevis Contours" /></p>

<h3>What data is available</h3>

<p>If you live in the UK <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> have released some &#8220;OpenData&#8221; which you can use. They actually released several complete maps but none of these are ideal for walking, they kept the Crown Jewels (Explorer &amp; Landranger). The products that are usefull to supplement <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/terrain-50.html" title="OS OpenData Terrain 50">OS Terrain 50</a> (replacing LAND-FORM Panorama)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html" title="OS VectorMap District">VectorMap District</a></li>
</ul>


<p>VectorMap district is actually an entire map product but we can borrow only the bits we need.
There are a lot of other sources of data out there for the UK and overseas. <a href="http://www.gis.naturalengland.org.uk/pubs/gis/GIS_register.asp" title="Natural England Data sets">Natural England</a> provide Open Access land data, so you could re-create those shaded orange areas. They provide a lot other data too but most is not needed on a walking map.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/BenNevisOSMB003.jpg" alt="Bodged together Map" /></p>

<h3>So what can we create?</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s a very quick bodged together map just to see what this data looks like, you can see it&#8217;s bodged together because it&#8217;s not layered correctly and it looks to be honest horrendous, but you can see if it was styled, it would have everything we need. Ths was created in a couple of minutes using <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS( QGIS)</a>, to do this properly and produce a usable map at the end I prefer other tools. In the next post I will explain how to create a usable Outdoors maps using the data mentioned above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/MapNoService.jpg" alt="No Map Service For You!" /></p>

<p>Over the last year I have been thinking about maps a lot, from using them in my day job, planning adventures in my spare time and for future job plans. Living in the UK the most obvious maps to use are from <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> and anyone who has even the most fleeting use for a map will generally be familiar with some of their maps. The paper <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;field-keywords=explorer%20lake%20district&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aexplorer%20lake%20district&amp;sprefix=explorer%20lake%20%2Caps%2C169&amp;tag=faitocom-21&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps" title="OS Lake District Maps">Explorer maps of the Lake District</a> that I keep in the boot of my car are looking very worn, although these days they rarely leave the boot. Why do they rarely leave their home?</p>

<p>Like most online outdoor walkers and bloggers I have used digital mapping for years, but always carry a paper map in case my digital device breaks or runs out of power. I rarely look at my paper map unless I want an overview of an area. Generally in somewhere like the Lake District I can recognise most of the landmarks and hills I can see around me. The map I generally have in my pack for this isn&#8217;t an Ordnance Survey map but the <a href="http://rcm-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=faitocom-21&amp;o=2&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=1851374671" title="Harvey Lake District Map">Harveys Lake District map</a>, yet this rarely leaves my pack either these days. All of this will be familiar to many outdoor enthusiasts who are embracing modern technology and using Digital mapping more and more.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/HarveyLakeDistrict.jpg" alt="Harvey Lake District Map" /></p>

<p>There are problems with digital mapping and I don&#8217;t mean running out of juice in your GPS device or smartphone. I&#8217;m talking about &#8220;Digital Map Lock In&#8221;, this is the most frustrating and frankly old fashioned thing about digital maps.</p>

<h3>What is Digital Map Lock In?</h3>

<p>In the UK the biggest provider of outdoor mapping data is <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a>, many (UK people probably) believe them to produce the finest maps in the world. These are the maps used by the majority of people walking in the UK both paper based and digital. Yet due to the way <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> licence, restrict and distribute their digital data they have produced and seam to actively encourage each company who uses their maps to produce outdoor mapping programs like <a href="http://www.memory-map.co.uk/" title="Memory-map">Memory-Map</a>, <a href="http://www.routebuddy.com/" title="RouteBuddy">Route Buddy</a>, <a href="http://www.anquet.com/" title="Anquet">Anquet</a> or Mobile specific apps like <a href="http://www.viewranger.com/" title="Viewranger">Viewranger</a> to create their own map format. Their map formats are &#8220;locked&#8221; to their program.</p>

<p>If I buy a digital map for <a href="http://www.memory-map.co.uk/" title="Memory-map">Memory-Map</a>, I can only use it in that program not in <a href="http://www.anquet.com/" title="Anquet">Anquet</a> or anything else. This sounds very familiar to digital music a few years ago, the songs were locked to iTunes or <a href="http://www.napster.com/" title="Napster">Napster</a> (legal version). If you wanted to play them in anything else you were out of luck. Unless you did a little <a href="http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/applications/11796-requiem-4-1-remove-itunes-drm-fairplay-music-video-books.html" title="Remove Apple DRM">research</a> and broke the law removing the Digital Rights Management (DRM). What did people do? They downloaded MP3s illegally, the music industry tried taking people to court and dishing out massive fines but did it work, No!</p>

<p>Eventually some of the music industry realised that things were/are changing, the models of old were crumbling and that their old model didn&#8217;t fit with todays generation. <a href="http://www.spotify.com" title="Spotify">Spotify</a> and similar services have appeared that offer consumers everything they had with their illegal sources (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster" title="Wikipedia - Napster">Napster</a>, <a href="http://www.limewire.com/" title="Limewire">Limewire</a>, etc) almost any song they desire in one convenient place and available on any device. People like myself were happy to pay for the service and I have done so every month since the first mobile app was released (3 years ago?). This model still has DRM with its restrictions, but I am happy to pay for it because I can listen to my music on everything I currently use (phone, computers, we browser and even now in programs like <a href="http://xbmc.org/" title="XBMC">XBMC</a>). I like the all I can eat model with the choice of millions of songs rather than the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/MP3-Music-Download/b/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;node=77197031&amp;tag=faitocom-21" title="Amazon MP3 Store">Amazon model</a> of no DRM but paying for each song model. Who has made the most money from me, <a href="http://www.spotify.com" title="Spotify">Spotify</a> by a mile (£9.99/month for 3+ years).</p>

<h3>All You Can Eat Maps</h3>

<p>So what has all this talk of music got to do with maps, well we need the same thing to happen with digital maps. I don&#8217;t want to be stuck using <a href="http://www.memory-map.co.uk/" title="Memory-map">Memory-Map</a> because I chose to buy a map from them 3 years ago or pay <a href="http://www.viewranger.com/" title="Viewranger">Viewranger</a> for the same area again to use it in their app. I want to pay for my <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps and be able to use them in any program or service and they be constantly up to date. I have no doubt someone is sat there thinking but you can&#8217;t do that with paper maps. Exactly that&#8217;s old fashioned and exactly the problem we have, we want new ideas not old ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/Mapping-Evolution-2011-009.jpg" alt="MM Tracker &amp; Memory-Map" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure someone else would point out that <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> provide an app for iPhone(<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/os-mapfinder/id577097874?mt=8" title="OS MapFinder">OS Map Finder</a>). I think this is the wrong move, I want Ordnance Survey to be the map producers and distributors with other companies providing software and services that use their data. I am happy to pay for a program or service and I have for <a href="http://alpinequest.psyberia.net/" title="AlpineQuest">AlpineQuest</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mmtrackerinfo/" title="MM Tracker">MM Tracker</a>, <a href="http://osmand.net/" title="OsmAnd">OSMand+</a> and many others.</p>

<p>What I would like is to pay a small monthly fee to have <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps available in any program and always up to date. <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> actually do already provide this service for business users, its called <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-ondemand/index.html" title="OS OnDemand">OS OnDemand</a> and it starts from £1,500 rising to £20,000 per year. Slightly out of reach of the normal outdoor enthusiast. What I believe <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> should do is offer a subscription map service for around £5 per month, this would allow me full access to their digital maps (possibly excluding MasterMap). They would provide the service and allow me to allow apps and services to use my subscription in the same way you approve access to your Twitter or Google account. This would provide an extra revenue stream for them, £60 per year from me and likely every other digital map user. This would mean apps like <a href="http://www.viewranger.com/" title="Viewranger">Viewranger</a> would need to charge for their app again, I paid for at least one version of their app already.</p>

<p>Obviously the service would have to allow caching of maps, otherwise the service would be useless in remote areas. Providing always up to date maps at each scale and for the whole of the UK is the incentive that would encourage users to constantly subscribe.</p>

<h3>Why would Ordnance Survey do this?</h3>

<p>In recent years <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> have generally had UK mapping to themselves other than the areas <a href="http://www.harveymaps.co.uk/" title="Harvey Maps">Harvey Maps</a> provide, but the average person likely has not seen or used them. I have only seen them available digitally for one program (even worse than OS). There is also a new kid on the block, actually its not that new. <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a> is celebrating its 9th year, but it is only recently that it is starting to become a realistic alternative to other major map providers like Ordnance Survey or Google for online maps. You may scoff at the thought of navigating the Cairngorms with an <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a>, but I believe its now almost possible if combined with contours and a grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/landscape.jpg" alt="Thunderforest Landscape Map" /></p>

<p>Anyone who has attended a mountain leader course will have navigated largely using contours. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;field-keywords=explorer%20lake%20district&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aexplorer%20lake%20district&amp;sprefix=explorer%20lake%20%2Caps%2C169&amp;tag=faitocom-21&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps" title="OS Lake District Maps">Ordnance Survey Explorer</a> maps can be very &#8220;busy&#8221; once you learn to use contours correctly. Take a look at <a href="http://www.thunderforest.com/" title="Thunderforest">Thunderforest</a> <a href="http://www.thunderforest.com/landscape/" title="Thunderforest Landscape">Landscape</a> and <a href="http://www.thunderforest.com/outdoors/" title="Thunderforest Outdoors">Outdoor</a> maps for examples that use <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OSM</a> data. They are still missing a few things in my opinion but the designer of those styles chose to omit some things like walls and fences. The biggest thing <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> has going for it is that it is open and the data is freely available to use by anyone and can be updated by anyone. So if something is missing go and add it. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I have spotted loads of mistakes on OS maps (intentional or otherwise) it can also take years for things to be added or removed. Not only should <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> be worried but so should Google, they already borrowed <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OSMs</a> model and now allow you to make updates to their maps using <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/mapmaker" title="Google Map Maker">Google Map Maker</a>. I am digressing, some of these thoughts will likely be discussed in future posts.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2657852/website/images/OSVectorMapDistrict.jpg" alt="OS VectorMap District" /></p>

<p>So returning to that question, why would <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> do this. Well they could and should provide a service like this now, rather than waiting until <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> have eaten away at their business. If they provided this service now I believe they would be opening up an untapped revenue stream and would be a leader once again. Almost all of the mobile apps available already provide <a href="http://http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> as well as Ordnance Survey. If the free data becomes as good or better why would you pay?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> needs to provide something that no one else can (currently) offer, don&#8217;t forget there is already free &#8221;<a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata-products.html" title="OS OpenData">OpenData</a>&#8221; release by Ordnance Survey that when combined with other free sources of data is potentially far better than what we currently pay for, keep an eye out for future posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally I have moved to a new host <a href="http://www.github.com">(Github)</a> and away from <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a>. This process started almost 12 months ago, but I am now almost finished. A lot of hard decisions have been made regarding the site, what to keep and what to remove. There is still a new theme to create but I didn&#8217;t want to delay any longer.</p>

<h3>Old Links to StevenHorner.com</h3>

<p>I won&#8217;t get into the technical side of it but I made a decision a lot of years ago that resulted in the inability to forward links to the new site. My advice to anyone setting up a site, enable permalinks.<br/>
Old links from external sites will take you to a custom error page which has links to the most popular posts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2010/09/19/mld-trailstar-review/">MLD Trailstar Review</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2010/09/22/mld-trailstar-pitching-guide/">MLD Trailstar Pitching Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2011/03/05/montane-lite-speed-h2o-jacket-review/">Montane Lite-Speed H2O Jacket Review</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2010/10/31/routes-my-way/">Routes: My Way</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

<p>If you subscribed to the RSS Feed for the site this also will no longer work, this time it&#8217;s not me but Google who have stopped supporting Feedburner. If like me, you love RSS Feeds you can resubscribe by using the link at the top right of the site.</p>

<h3>So why the change &amp; the delay?</h3>

<p>I was sick of the site running slowly, which was the result partly of the host <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">(Godaddy)</a>, the platform <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">(Wordpress)</a> and my configuration of the site. The delay was mainly due to exporting the posts from the Wordpress and losing all the formatting, but the old posts are migrated. What this means is that I can now concentrate on new content, the delay to migrating the site has resulted in 0 posts in the last 6 months. There are several new posts either written or almost complete. I am looking forward to regularly posting again.</p>

<p>Apologies for the disruption, hopefully due to the design of the new site this should not happen again. If you spot any links that do not work or errors please let me know and I will fix them as soon as I can.</p>

<h3>Update 18th August 2013</h3>

<p>Another 8 months and nothing posted. There have been lots of reasons from drive failures and loss of completed posts to back problems and whole host of other things.</p>

<p>Something is stirring in many small villages and towns throughout England &amp; Wales. In normally quiet villages, people are angrily discussing the latest happenings in the woods and fields around them. People who normally keep themselves to themselves are beginning to stand up and share their voice. So what&#8217;s causing these normally quiet villagers to break their silence?</p>
