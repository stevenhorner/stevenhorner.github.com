I am a lightweight backpacker based in the North of England, but you could find me anywhere in the UK or Europe. Pointy bits (Mountains) are my locations of choice.  

My background is in computers, fixing, maintaining, coding and anything else related. Staring at a screen all day helpdes you appreciate the beauty of the outdoors.  

If you have an idea for a trip, gear to test, would like advice or you could help me further my adventures please contact me at the address below.  
Thanks  
Steven
