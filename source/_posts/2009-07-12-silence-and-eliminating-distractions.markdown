I did an experiment for 5 days earlier this week, which was to cut out news and other sources of distractions such as Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader and a few similar sites. The surprising things were just how much free time I had and that I didn't really miss them, maybe Twitter a little bit. The main thing I realised was just how much time I waste doing nothing, sat waiting for someone to post something to Twitter or Facebook. I have started using them all again over the last couple of days and noticed how my spare time disappeared once again. From tomorrow I am not going to cut them out, just limit to about an hour a day and generally avoid mainstream news. I decided to do the little experiment while reading the Timothy Ferriss book "[The 4-hour Work Week](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091923727?ie=UTF8&tag=faitocom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0091923727)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=faitocom-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0091923727)", I am still reading the book and for the first time since I was 15 I've marked loads of things in a book to re-read, do or go into more detail on. I can't recommend it enough.
