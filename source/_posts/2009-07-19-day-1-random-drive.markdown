I've driven about 280 miles roughly today and have stopped in Fort William. I'm staying the night in the Alexandra, decided to pop in and see how much it was (Â£59). I thought it was quite cheap but I can see why, it's quite tatty but it's better than the car. The bar is deserted except for me, will finish this pint then go for a walk. Will have an early night Reading then be up early for Breakfast. Thinking about driving to Skye tomorrow, stopping at Loch Ness on the way. May continue further up though past Ullapool and look for a deserted beach. That's tomorrow though, will continue to post on Twitter rather than here.
