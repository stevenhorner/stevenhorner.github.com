I was just reading [Kevin Shannons Because it is there blog](http://www.becauseitisthere.co.uk/) and he had posted this quote from [Beachcombing in Miramar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d.html/ref=aw_wl_1_1/275-6822971-2632252?coliid=IGA1DUJBDQOF1&a=0446672769&colid=JI8UPPN38GNV). From these few paragraphs it sounds like my sort of book. “I have a choice, the same choice that faces every man. I can live a frivolous life, trying to impress others with the house I live in, the clothes I wear, the car I drive. I can strive to be a success in the way of the world, seeking the admiration of others, reveling in their jealousy. I can seek domination over my family and fellow workers in a vain attempt to hide my own deficiencies. I can seek fame, which is the most elusive pursuit of all, for it has no substance and soon vanishes in the air. I can indulge in endless prattle about my friends and neighbors, dissipating my life’s energy a little at a time. I can wallow in self-pity, refusing to accept responsibility for my own circumstances. I can manipulate others into taking care of me, which is the way of all petty tyrants. I can complain about boredom, as if it were up to those around me to inject excitement into my day. “These are the patterns of the living dead, people who have forsaken life, who are willing to squander their most precious gift, because they refuse to face up to the reality of death. If they wanted to live, truly wanted to live, they would rise up in a resurrection of their own making and commit themselves to the life they have.”
