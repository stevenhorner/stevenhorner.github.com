![Too Much Noise](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Noise.jpg) I've disabled the "Fresh from FriendFeed and Twitter" Plugin on the site, too much noise was being posted on here. Everything can still be seen in the FriendFeed sidebar. I will now have to actually start posting some stuff on here again and maybe get around to creating a template.
