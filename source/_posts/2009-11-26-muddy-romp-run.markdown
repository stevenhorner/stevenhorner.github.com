[![Muddy Romp](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Muddy-Romp-300x293.jpg)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Muddy-Romp.jpg)**Distance:** 2.6 miles A very short run to clear my head in horrible weather. It was p***ing it down with strong winds, which made it quite hard to run when facing the wind head on. I enjoyed the run though, at the beginning up the track and my favourite bit through the mud of the woods near the end. I felt like a kid again jumping into the puddles and mud rather than trying to avoid it like a sensible person. You can see the incredibly bad stats for the run [here](http://connect.garmin.com/activity/19651910).
