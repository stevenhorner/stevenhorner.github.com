![specialized1](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/specialized1-300x225.jpg) Here's my new bike, a [Specialized FSR XC Exper](http://www.bikescene.co.uk/moreinfo.php?variation=1458&sale=0)[t](http://www.bikescene.co.uk/moreinfo.php?variation=1458&sale=0). I got it cheaper than listed on most sites, thank god. It was bought from [Bike Scene](http://www.bikescene.co.uk/) in Guisborough, I went for a short 6.5 mile ride once I got home. The route was a mixture of bridle ways with some very rough track down a fast hill. This gave the suspension a workout, must of been travelling twice as fast as I had previously ridden down the track on a non suspension bike. Easily could of gone faster but the brakes aren't bedded in yet, so had to take it slightly easier. Can't wait to get out again.
