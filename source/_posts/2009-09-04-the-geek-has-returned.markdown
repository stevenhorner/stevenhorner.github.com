For the last year, possibly two for some reason I've hardly messed around with computers. Yeah I've sat and stared at the screen like a zombie on Facebook, Twitter and god knows how many other "Time wasting" sites. I hadn't got stuck in and built a computer or taken something apart or really messed around in code. I also stopped my old blog and for some reasonÂ  the "geek" in me was hidden away. Yet this week I decided it was time to sort out all the old computer crap in the cupboards, build up a spare computer out of old parts and get rid of the rest. I now have a machine up and running and have a stack of about 10 drives I am securely erasing. I had put off for months taking apart the old computers, yet I found myself strangely enjoying it today. I realised just how much I actually missed messing around with computers and learning everything I could. Over the last few months, I've been seriously thinking of leaving working in IT. My head is now back buzzing with ideas, although I hope I can use some of the things I've read and learned recently to focus on achieving some of those ideas. Rather than never finishing any, as is usually the case.
