I've just watched [Alex: A Passion For Life](http://bit.ly/1MsJxO) after reading about it on [Peewiglets blog](http://peewiglet.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/i-hate-to-sound-trite-but/). Its about a young man with Cystic Fibrosis who's ambition is to conduct the St Matthew Passion. There was a program a couple of years ago about him, which I never saw. This is defintely worth watching to see someone with serious health problems but determined to not let them get in his way. He puts most of us to shame.
