The weather is going to delay my trip to Scotland, I really don't want to spend my holiday trudging along in torrential rain and struggling to sleep. Luckily I have taken 2 weeks leave, so I'm hoping the weather will improve. Instead of going to Scotland tomorrow I'm going to do some jobs around the house and start work on [zippymap](http://www.zippymap.com) again. It's about time I stopped thinking about it and got on with it!
