[![Cock o the north run](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Cock-o-the-north-run-253x300.jpg)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Cock-o-the-north-run.jpg)**Distance:** 6.3 miles I went for a run last night the first in months, I'd agreed to go earlier in the week and had expected to run about 4 miles at most. We ended up running to the old Cock O' The North round-a-bout and back. I haven't ran regularly since June, with maybe 2 runs since then. I have never found it easy running on tarmac, my left knee never thanks me. The outward half wasn't too bad but I got slower and slower on the way back. I ended up finishing 5 minutes behind my running partner, although I was happy I didn't give in and kept running to the end. I wont say how long it took me or the speed I ran out but if your interested you could look at the [log here](http://bit.ly/8MdngO). Much Improvement is needed. Below is a chart showing my heart rate, the highest was 205 bpm, average 197 bpm. This makes me sound like I'm about to die, well it felt like it, but this is normal for me (not the death bit).
