![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Munro-Week-August-2010-054-1.jpg) Below are some simple pitching instructions for the Mountain Laurel Designs Trailstar, which follows on from my earlier [review](http://www.stevenhorner.com/?p=1003). Hopefully these are simple enough to follow. [caption id="attachment_1053" align="alignnone" width="450" caption="Figure 1"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-002.jpg)[/caption] 1. Set poles to the correct heights, 47" & 44" for my Pacer Poles.

Peg Trailstar loosely on the ground by the main corner peg out points, allowing plenty of slack near the MLD logo (door) see figure 2. [caption id="attachment_1058" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Figure 3"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-023.jpg)[/caption] 3. Take your heighest pole (47") and place in the centre as your main support, should now look like figure 3. [caption id="attachment_1056" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Figure 4"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-025.jpg)[/caption] [caption id="attachment_1057" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Figure 5"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-033.jpg)[/caption] 4. Go to the back corner, opposite the door it will look like slack picture in figure 4. Move the stake so seam/ridge is tight, then move the peg to the right so the panel is tight, do the same to left it should now look like the tight picture (figure 5). [caption id="attachment_1055" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Figure 6"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-021.jpg)[/caption] 5. Do the same for the remaining 2 main peg out points pulling all the slack towards the door (MLD logo) which should now look like figure 6. [caption id="attachment_1063" align="alignnone" width="450" caption="Figure 7"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-028.jpg)[/caption] [caption id="attachment_1059" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Figure 8"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-056.jpg)[/caption] 6. Take your remaining pole (44") and push the point into the ground in front of the door. Wrap the guy twice around below where the guy comes from the Trailstar end, then wrap again twice above (figure 7). Pull the guy line tight from the pole to the ground and stake in place. Adjust the guys if needed. Hopefully the Trailstar now looks like figure 8. [caption id="attachment_1060" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Figure 9"]![](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Trailstar-045.jpg)[/caption] 7. The Trailstar is now perfectly stable, I normally stake the remaining 4 points just to add extra security in the wind (figure 9). If you have any problems regarding pitching or would like to correct anything I've said please comment.
