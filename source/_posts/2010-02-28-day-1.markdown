It's the 1st day of the West Highland Way, 7 miles done and sat in the pub. The crazy scots don't allow you buy alcohol on a Sunday until 12:30, a Tennents tastes better when you have to wait.  

I didn't set off until 10 and have had a slow wander bur still doing a reasonable pace.

My aim for today is a campsite I can't spell without looking at the map, Easter Drumquhassle Farm about a mile from Drymen. It's only another 4 miles up the road, no rush. That's if it's open, but website said it was. 

Total mileage today should be under 12 miles. Tomorrows is about 15 to Rowardennan. My Lamb burger has arrived...
