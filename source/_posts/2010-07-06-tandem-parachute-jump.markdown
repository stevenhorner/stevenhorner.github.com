[Skydive](http://vimeo.com/13136491) from [Steven Horner](http://vimeo.com/user4209855) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).  

I was going through some of my video and found this, its the video from the tandem parachute jump I did at the end of 2006 (I think). I look quite miserable (and fatter), maybe I was nervous, but I can remember being strangely calm. I tried uploading this years ago to YouTube, but it was over their 10 minute limit.
