**Distance:** 6 miles  

I did this walk last Sunday with my dad, it was in very heavy rain. The original plan was for a 10 miles walk but the rain was so heavy we cut it short.

It woul be quite a nice walk on a sunnier day, but this was the heaviest rain I've walked in for a long time. When I got back to the car I found my iPhone and Camera had drowned in the dry bag. The bag is supposed to keep everything dry but I was stood for a while waiting to put my car keys in, while my dad was messing around with his GPS. I think rain ran in while I was stood there with the bag open.
