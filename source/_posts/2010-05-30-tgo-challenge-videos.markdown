I recorded a few videos on the challenge, none very exciting. I really wish I had done more but was unsure how the camera battery would last. All veyr boring but they're embeded below anyway. I'd recommend you check out [Phils videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/MrPhilTurner) a few have me in (oh no), like [this](http://www.youtube.com/user/MrPhilTurner#p/u/4/VyoWtRcgqsI).
