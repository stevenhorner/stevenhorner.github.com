Finally I have moved to a new host [(Github)](http://www.github.com) and away from [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) to [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org). This process started almost 12 months ago, but I am now almost finished. A lot of hard decisions have been made regarding the site, what to keep and what to remove. There is still a new theme to create but I didn't want to delay any longer.

###Old Links to StevenHorner.com  
I won't get into the technical side of it but I made a decision a lot of years ago that resulted in the inability to forward links to the new site. My advice to anyone setting up a site, enable permalinks.  
Old links from external sites will take you to a custom error page which has links to the most popular posts:  

*   [MLD Trailstar Review](http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2010/09/19/mld-trailstar-review/)  
*   [MLD Trailstar Pitching Guide](http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2010/09/22/mld-trailstar-pitching-guide/)  
*   [Montane Lite-Speed H2O Jacket Review](http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2011/03/05/montane-lite-speed-h2o-jacket-review/)  
*   [Routes: My Way](http://www.stevenhorner.com/blog/2010/10/31/routes-my-way/)  

###RSS Feed  
If you subscribed to the RSS Feed for the site this also will no longer work, this time it's not me but Google who have stopped supporting Feedburner. If like me, you love RSS Feeds you can resubscribe by using the link at the top right of the site.

###So why the change & the delay?  
I was sick of the site running slowly, which was the result partly of the host [(Godaddy)](http://www.godaddy.com), the platform [(Wordpress)](http://www.wordpress.com) and my configuration of the site. The delay was partly due to exporting the posts from the Wordpress and it losing all the formatting, also I have been busy but the old posts are migrated. What this means is that I can now concentrate on new content, the delay to migrating the site has resulted in 0 posts in the last 6 months. There are several new posts either written or almost complete. I am looking forward to regularly posting again.  

Apologies for the disruption, hopefully due the design of the new site this should not happen again. If you spot any links that do not work or errors please let me know and I will fix as as soon as I can.
