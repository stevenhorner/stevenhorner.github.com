![Motherboard](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Motherboard-288x300.jpg) It's been a while since I've built a new computer, the last was an emergency build a year or so ago when my server blew up. I haven't built a main desktop computer in years, mainly due to not playing PC games anymore. I've been getting by, for almost a year on an old PowerPC Mac Mini after my desktop windows machine also blew up. Strange, 2 machines popped within a few weeks (I blame the power). I also have a laptop and another old desktop machine, I did have another 7 computers in the cupboard but stripped these down and disposed of a few weeks back. Anyway below are the components I just ordered from Ebuyer. I already have several cases, DVD Writers, etc so don't need those. 

  * [Western Digital 500GB 32MB Cache Caviar Black](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/150246) -£41.57
  * [AMD Phenom II X4 955 Black Edition 3.2 GHz Socket AM3 8MB](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/164047) -£134.92
  * [Crucial 4GB (2x2GB) DDR3 1333MHz/PC3-10600 Memory Kit](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/166995) -£63.86
  * [Gigabyte GA-MA785GMT-UD2H 785G Socket AM3 Motherboard](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/170230) - £71.12
I have used Dabs for years, but after a change in their delivery arrangements and costs I wont be again. It's also almost impossible to speak to a human at Dabs. I used [Ebuyer](http://www.ebuyer.com/) over 2 years ago to buy an MP3 player for walking and received excellent service. That combined with a recommendation from [Mr Craddock](http://jonathancraddock.com/), made me try them again. They tell me my order will be here by 11am, excellent if it is. I was also going to buy Windows 7, but decided to hold off for now. £107 for Professional OEM made that decision. The last O.S. I can remember buying on launch day was Windows 95, would of also bought 98 but I was on holiday. I will have a play around with Win 7 RC if it still works, otherwise XP it is.
