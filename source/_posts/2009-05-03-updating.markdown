I decided to have another lazy day (like most days) and have changed the theme of this blog to something slightly different, but still very simple. At some point I will design one from scratch, but its not a priority. I've also added a plugin that will pull my Twitter and FriendFeed posts/tweets into blog posts. So at least there should be fresh content on here most days. I may have to play with the settings a bit, lots of junk could get posted.
