Today I went for my first run in months on my lunch break. I struggled, which isn't surprising considering how long its been and the enforced recent lack of exercise due to my feet. This probably wont be a regular posting on the website, but thought I'd checkout how [Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com) looks embeded in a website which is below. You can use this for walking, cycling, running, etc... If you really want to keep track of me, you could click view details and from there follow my progress if any at all. Oh and you could check out how my heart rate is, if I'd left it tracking you would of seen it spike to 238bpm a few minutes after the run finished.
