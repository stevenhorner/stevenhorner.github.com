![run](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/run-300x271.jpg) I did the regular work run tonight, although guess its not regular anymore. I got half way round and my heart rate was even higher than usual, so decided to walk.  Then 5 minutes later when my heart rate had lowered and I was walking, my heart felt funny like it missed a beat or fluttered or something. Then didn't  quite catch my breath for a second or two, looked at my HRM and it jumped up to 226 bpm. I wasn't doing anything strenuous and hadn't been running for several minutes. The spike in bpm only lasted a few seconds before it lowered again but unsettling that its happened more in the last 3 months than in the previous 18 months. Heart rate and speed are shown below in a graph. ![heart1](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/heart1-300x135.jpg) The full run details and heart graph can be seen on MotionBased [here](http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/email/accept.mb?senderPk.pkValue=18698&unitSystemPkValue=2&episodePk.pkValue=8274238).
