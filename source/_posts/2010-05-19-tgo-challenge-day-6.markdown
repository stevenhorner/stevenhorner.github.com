After feeling really down last night, I'd stuck on "The Playlist" that me, Phil & Hendrik had made and I was soon cheered up. Bridge over Troubled Water and then Solitude by Black Sabbath saw to that.  

I set off walking at 6 and before I knew it I'd reached Feshie Bridge. After this all the paths looked much the same, Forest paths and roads through trees, luckily it was cooler than yesterday. I ditched the Sealskinz socks which made my feet feel a bit fresher but can feel every rock through my feet now.  
<!-- more -->
I've almost destroyed my custom insoles, so may change to originals which should give more cushioning but less support.  

Eventually reaching the first of 2 lochs I started to slow and take in the scenery, stopping at each seat and relaxing a bit more.  

There's not much to say about the route, other than seeing lots of deer again and realising just how big the forest is in this area.  

I got to the campsite at 11, pitched the Trailstar then walked the 2 miles to Aviemore for Compeed, batteries and sun cream. Annoyingly the only place I could find Compeed was at the far end of town in Boots. I demolished Fish & Chips before walking back to the campsite. Just as I got back Phil rang to see where I was in Aviemore. No way I was walking in again I've already walked 17 miles today.  

So basically I am determined to go on, my feet still hurt but what the hell, stuff like this is what tests your resolve and determination. Had a text a while ago that Phil is on his way so I'm signing off for now...
