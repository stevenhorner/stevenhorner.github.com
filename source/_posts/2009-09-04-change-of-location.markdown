I should of known it was a bad idea to tell everyone I was going to Scotland. Due to lots of bills (Car Tax, Insurance, break down cover, etc, etc..) I can't afford to travel around Scotland or at least not this month. So rather than straining the plastic even more, I'm going to change the destination to the Lake District. It's probably a bad idea mentioning it on here, in case that changes too. Although I need some time away and what better way than wildcamping in the hills. It's also a hell of a lot cheaper than the fuel to Scotland. Hopefully tomorrow I will sit down with some maps and decide the places I would like to go and figure out how to walk between them. For the last couple of years I've generally marked out a route on the computer and followed it on the GPS. This time hopefully I will go old Skool and rely on old fashioned maps. I was going to say and compass but think I still might use the GPS for my coordinates then check on a map. I'm kinda sad that I'm not gonna be able to go up to Scotland next week, especially after spending ages deciding on the places I wanted to visit. It's not a bad alternative though, if only I can get a few dry sunny days...
