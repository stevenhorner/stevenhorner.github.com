It takes me ages to write a blog post, which is why they are so infrequent and the draft posts list for this blog is so long. I dabbled with video on the [Loch Lomond Adventure](http://www.stevenhorner.com/?p=674) and decided to give it another go. This may not be exciting I'm afraid, but let me know what you think.  

To make it more interesting count how many times I say "fantastic" and thought about adding Vic Reeves- Dizzy at one point but decided against it.  

The boat was named Doris by John at [Shed Dweller Moments](http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/), because I said I would need to mug some old grannies to afford it. He said it should be named Doris in memory of all the grannies who fell for me to buy her (I didn't mug anyone).
