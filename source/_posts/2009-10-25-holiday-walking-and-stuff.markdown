I'm on holiday for 2 weeks, so far I've just spent the weekend sleeping and doing very little. I've been thinking of doing a longish distance walk but can't decide what to do, especially with the weather looking a bit iffy. So that I get out and not sit on my arse I decided Monday and Tuesday I'd go for some day walks with my dad. Tomorrow I'm off for a fairly short 7.5 mile walk from Eggleston, which was in Country Walking a couple of years ago. I will decide tomorrow where I'm going on Tuesday. I'm still toying with the idea of doing the West Highland Way but really I have left it a bit late to sort stuff out for it (maybe an excuse). My dad said he would do it next spring with me, but not sure I will have the holiday time with other things I have planned for the year. I have loads of little jobs to do and various computer projects I should be getting on with. My mind has has been working overtime recently thinking about Zippymap ideas (needs a rename). My first small project will be to create some frames/backs for my hill bagging charts. I've got a Wainwright, Mountains of England & Wales and soon [Munro & Corbett](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/185137289X/ref=s9_wishx_gw_ir03?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=0AWJV8K066WW8RMWXA1E&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467198433&pf_rd_i=468294) charts. Which I want to put a wooden back on each and hang like a picture rather than blue tacking to the wall (just painted the walls). I also want some sort of pin board that I can add pictures or things that give me ideas, but don't really like those cork or green/blue fabric things.
