The website has had a slight design refresh, I've been using the [ColdBlue](http://webrevolutionary.com/coldblue/) Wordpress theme for a few weeks but needed a new header image. I must of mentioned this to [Jonathan Craddock](http://www.jonathancraddock.com) who sent a [picture](http://twitpic.com/r2rnl) of one by Twitter. He kindly split the image into seperate files and emailed them. I quickly got the background mountains to display, but the logo caused me a headache for the next 3 hours. Always a problem modifying other peoples code. Anyway its up there and looks loads better than what was there before, I may modify the Steven Horner logo in the future though.
