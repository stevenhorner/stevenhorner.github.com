Last weekend I went to Scotland with the aim of finally walking Buachaille Etive Mor, this has been top of my "must do" list for ages. It was also a chance to meet [Helen](http://twitter.com/HelenJFisher/) for the first time, [Oi Nutter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83n3X0S_lFE). Instead of me writing a long boring route description, you can read Helens thoughts on the weekend and her thoughts on the future [here](http://helenswonderings.blogspot.com/2010/08/post-scotland-blues.html). Below is a video I threw together (due to lack of time), apologies for the lack of editing and me waffling on about nothing for ages.  I have a couple of other posts in the pipe line, but have been a bit unsure how to follow up my last one.
