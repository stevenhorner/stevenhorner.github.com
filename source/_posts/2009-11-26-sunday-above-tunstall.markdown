[![Above Tunstall](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Above-Tunstall-300x199.jpg)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Above-Tunstall.jpg)**Distance:** 6.2 miles A short walk with the folks on Sunday morning at one of my favourite places, Tunstall. It was a bit of a wet day but far better than sitting in the house. Unfortunately there's no pictures, it was raining and I didn't want to break another iPhone by getting it wet.
