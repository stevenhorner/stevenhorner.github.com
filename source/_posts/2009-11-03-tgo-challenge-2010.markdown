I read this morning on [Mike Knipes blog](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnorthernpies.blogspot.com%2F&ei=IcLwSpCoFsnajQeA4N24CA&usg=AFQjCNH8NYLacP6jOz7Pfiy2HNXC5ERNPQ&sig2=E_3w1Wo0j4FWKFMEvMfXxw) that emails were being sent out to let people know if they had got into the [TGO Challenge 2010](http://www.tgochallenge.co.uk/). After staring at my inbox for a couple of hours and nothing arriving I decided to sit down and read [Crush It](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0061914177?ie=UTF8&tag=faitocom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0061914177) while I waited. I lost track of time and read a Tweet from [Darren Christie](http://whitespider1066.com/) asking if I got in. Dived to the computer to check my email, there was one there from Roger Smith. I had to re-read the email a couple of times to take in that I had actually got a place. So in May next year I will be walking from the West Coast to the East Coast of Scotland by a route that I will be planning over the next few weeks. I've already ordered an overview map of Scotland ([Scotland OS Tour Map](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0319245365?ie=UTF8&tag=faitocom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0319245365)) to help with the planning. I've had a big smile on my face all day since reading the email.
