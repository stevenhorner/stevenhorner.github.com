My head has been all over this week, everywhere but work. All I can think about is walking, routes, maps & gear.

I haven't finalised my route for the [TGO challenge](http://www.tgochallenge.co.uk/) yet, I'm intending to sit down at the weekend and not move until I decide on my route. It's more or less taken shape itself somehow, including Sheil Bridge, Fort Augustus, Kingussie, Braemar, Tarfside & St Cyrus. Those are the main towns I would be going through, from what I've read there are several doing almost an identical route which is sort of why I haven't filled in the rest in that description. I would like a few days of solitude (I think), so might rehash the rest or maybe even the whole thing.

Besides for the Challenge, I've also decided I will redo the [West Highland Way](http://www.west-highland-way.co.uk/home.asp) and finish it. Previously I stopped at Crianlarich and got the train home, I learnt a lot about gear and more importantly myself on that failed trip. In the 2.5 years that's passed since, a lot as happened (not enough walking). I'm intending to get to Milngavie on 27th February 2009, I'm yet to confirm the time off work though. This is quite early to walk the [West Highland Way](http://www.west-highland-way.co.uk/home.asp) I guess but it will give me a chance to test some of the gear I want to take on the[ TGOC](http://www.tgochallenge.co.uk/) and by late February I will be desperate for some time off work. [Phil Turner](http://phil-turner.net/) may walk from Bridge of Orchy with me, if he's free at the time.

I said my mind was full of walking, not content with the above 2 walks, I also have [The Cape Wrath Trail](http://www.capewrathtrail.com/) stuck in my head. This is another 200 mile walk from Fort William to Cape Wrath, which from driving through the area is probably the most stunning scenery I've seen in the UK. I haven't done any researchÂ  into it yet and the major problem is the time of year I would want to do it, I imagine it's the wrong time. Late August/early September is smack bang in the middle of the stalking season and I'm guessing the midges and Ticks will be bad then. This needs a lot more thought. My dad said did I not fancy doing the Pennine Way, but my image of the 2 walks are very different and know where my heart lies.

I will have 6 weeks of holiday to take next year and don't want to be sat on my arse staring at the computer on my holidays.

Oh the reason for Buachaille Etive Mor above, besides for it looking fantastic. I'm thinking about driving up to [Kings House Hotel](http://www.kingy.com/) on New Years Eve and doing some walking on New Years Day. This is just a thought at the moment, but would be an excellent start to hopefully an amazing year.
