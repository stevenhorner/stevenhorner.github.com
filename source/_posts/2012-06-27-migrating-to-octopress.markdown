What's this?
============

For several years [stevenhorner.com] [l1] has ran on Wordpress using my own host ([Godaddy] [l2]) which has in the main be OK, but over the last year I have had several problems generally with the host. I also miss the geeky side of websites back when I first started messing about with website in 94/95 it was very basic handcoded HTML and progressed from there. These days you can be completely hidden from everything and type like you would in a Wordprocessor. At least that's the idea, various problems with Wordpress TinyMCE and CSS of my site had caused me to write everything in the HTML view anyway.

I started looking into alternative at the end of 2011 and liked the idea of a site without a database backend, which just slows the site down. [Hendrik] [l3] at the same time was also looking into the same thing and he mentioned [Octopress] [l4] after a little play with it I decided it could work. Then work and other things got in the way and I never got around to doing anything. Then a week ago while on holiday I got an email from [Godaddy][l2] to say my site would be suspended in a couple of days if I didn't delete some files. I hadn't changed anything in ages and couldn't understand why this was happening now. 

It turns out that 2 years ago a plugin I had installed within Wordpress created lots of backups of my entire site without me realising and the host had just picked up on it now. Anyway this was finally the catalyst to to some work on my site. Strangely [Hendrik] [l3] has also resumed his efforts to move to [Octopress] [l4], he's ahead of me though.

I am intending to use [Github] [l4] to host my site for now, but I do fancy playing with AWS again. For now though [Github] [l4] is free and AWS costs so its a no brainer.
