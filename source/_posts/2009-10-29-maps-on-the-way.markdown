I've always loved maps, when I was 10 I can remember getting my geography booklet out of the cupboard at school and completing it because I couldn't wait until the following week to answer the questions on maps. I'm not quite sure why I like them but I do. I mentioned in a previous post that I had a mini project to create something to mountÂ  maps to the wall. I haven't done this yet, because I ordered another 2 maps. I already listed the [Munro & Corbett](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/185137289X?ie=UTF8&tag=faitocom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=185137289X) chart but I also ordered the [Long Distance Path Chart](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/185137387X?ie=UTF8&tag=faitocom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=185137387X), unfortunately there's a 1-3 week wait on it. Maybe I need a bigger wall to put this lot on: [![Munro & Corbett](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Munro-Corbett-94x150.jpg)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Munro-Corbett.JPG)[![England & wales](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/England-wales1-150x150.jpg)[![LDP Chart](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/LDP-Chart-95x150.jpg)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/LDP-Chart.JPG)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/England-wales1.jpg) [![The Wainwrights](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/The-Wainwrights-150x150.jpg)](http://www.stevenhorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/The-Wainwrights.jpg) Anyway I spent an hour or so leaning over another map on my dining table today, the [Ben Nevis OS 41](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1851372334?ie=UTF8&tag=faitocom-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1851372334). This covers Fort William, Glen Nevis & Glen Coe. If the weather isn't too bad (don't mind some rain) then I should be heading that direction next week. I have an idea of where I would like to walk, but don't want to say and not do it again. I cancelled the idea of the Bob Graham round, because this will be the only full weeks holiday I will have for a few months and I can get to the Lake District any weekend.
