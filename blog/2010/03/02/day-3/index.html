<div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t get out of bed until the third alarm went off at 7:30. I joined the other 3 people sat for breakfast. There was an elderly gentleman and a couple who sounded German. Their packs were behind them, which looked quite large.</p>

<p>I never spoke to anyone other than the waitress, until I&#8217;ve eaten I tend not to talk much. After which I don&#8217;t shut up.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Once back in the room, the tent and sleeping bag were packed after drying overnight and I set off at about 9.</p>

<p>From Rowardennan I headed past the Youth Hostel, which looks fantastic with a beautiful position on the loch. Soon after I passed the official wild campsite which didn&#8217;t look too inviting, a frost hollow.</p>

<p>The next section is the bit that stuck in my mind from last time. A Forest track up through the woods, I went the high route (Duncan &#8220;Aktoman&#8221; had said the low route was bad on his blog). It&#8217;s quite hard on the feet and I stopped early to apply Compeed plasters to my toes on the right foot. My left foot is fine, something to do with the right being half a size smaller (shoes too big for it).</p>

<p>After an hour or so I spotted a couple walking ahead and recognised them as the couple from breakfast. I caught then up and stopped to talk to them. They were German and were walking the West Highland Way too, they were heading for a B&B; in Inveranan. They noted my small pack compared to the guys and were surprised when I said it had a tent and food, etc. They were both walking in jeans, rather them than me.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the walk once the wide track ended, stopping several times to take pics. Before I knew it I was close to Inversnaid and the hotel. Looking at my watch it was 12. The rear walkers entrance was blocked by a bin, heading round the front I considered walking on. The thought of a refreshing lemonade drew me in. Unfortunately I was told the bar was closed, but could have tea or coffee. Tea it was then, sitting in the window I saw the German couple arrive and sit on a bench outside. I had forgot to ask names earlier, I found out the lads name was Johanus.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t stay long, a couple of chocolate bars were bought for lunch and off I set. The going gets a little harder from here, with the path winding it&#8217;s way around and over trees.</p>

<p>The time passed quickly, passing only a handfull of people. Soon I found myself near Doune Bothy and stopped for a rest and photos. The actual bothy was full ok kids, a school trip maybe.</p>

<p>Once starting to reach civilisation the rubbish increases and for some reason the going gets slower. Knowing I was near Beinglas I rushed up Knap mor (small hill), clearly a little too fast. The old heart problem kicked in, rather than stopping as I should, I kept going. I had no energy and decided I had to stop. I sat for 2 minutes, I feel a strange sensation in my heart and afterwards I&#8217;m back to normal. I actually felt like I had even more energy.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I spoke to a guy who was a shepherd I guess and asked if I could leave the kissing gate off further on, to let the sheep through. 15 minutes later I was at beinglas, where a couple of diggers were driving about. Everything looked closed, I spoke to a guy who told me they weren&#8217;t open until the end of the month. I asked if I could camp but was told no. He said the nearest campsite was Tyndrum, hmm.</p>

<p>I asked where else I could stay and was pointed to Inverarnan to the Drovers Inn or a B&amp;B. I considered heading on for a wildcamp but from memory the next few miles are low and quite visible. I&#8217;d walked the extra 7 miles especially for the campsite &amp; a pint :-(</p>

<p>Within about 30 seconds I&#8217;d decided on the Drovers. I&#8217;d hoped to pop in anyway after reading about the cosy bar. I didn&#8217;t fancy a B&amp;B (full anyway according to signs), always feel like someones front room. The Drovers Lodge opposite looked closed, but later kept seeing people from hotel head around the back.</p>

<p>I was told there was no single rooms, a double was Â£59. Christ expensive, compared to my tent. I headed up to my room, each has a name. Mine is room 14 and was shocked to see the name on the door &#8220;Bridal suite&#8221;, which has a 4 poster. I would be disappointed if this was my room for my wedding night.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a fine line between a room with character from age and one in need of some work. This falls into the later, it reminds me of my grans house (which is good) and a place I used to stay in Amulree on holiday (also good), expensive for the money &amp; needs work. Shared bathroom, no tv, etc. Which don&#8217;t bother me, I don&#8217;t gave them in my tent either.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m now holed up in the bar in front of the fire, it&#8217;s been quiet until now when about 20 people just arrived, looking like skiers or boarders. Just spoke to one of them in the toilet (as you do), he&#8217;d been boarding in Glencoe, best day he&#8217;d ever had boarding in Scotland with fantastic conditions. Tomorrow is a short walk to my wigwam in Strathfillan. This is part of the reason I didn&#8217;t want to walk any further, the day tomorrow is already no more than 9 miles. I am tempted to divert to Crianlarich to the shop just to waste some time tomorrow. I&#8217;m justifying so many hotels because all of my holidays this year are already booked for walking. WHW now, hiking in Finland (end of April/May), TGO Challenge in May and Wainwrights coast to coast in September. So this is my luxury holiday. I am supposed to be wildcamping on Saturday night with Phil, we had hoped the top of the Devils staircase but we will see&#8230;(fingers crossed).</p>

<p>I now have a day off on Friday due to not walking Munros. Wondering about getting the bus up from Bridge of Orchy on Friday for half a day boarding in Glencoe, then bus back. Unsure if they hire gear, possibly not ,but will check it out.</p>

<p>The signal is very weak in the building ( due to thick walls) so probably won&#8217;t add pictures today, sadly.</p>
