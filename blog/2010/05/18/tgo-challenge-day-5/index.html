<div class="entry-content"><p>Before I write about the day I will say from the start, I&#8217;m laid here feeling sorry for myself and quite upset.</p>

<p>I suppose I better explain why first. I&#8217;m laid in the shelter with blisters on top of blisters. I&#8217;ve walked 23 miles (5 more than planned) in weather that you would be lucky to get in July/August, it was 24c in the shade, but felt hotter in direct sun. I started walking at 6:45, but was in no rush due to hoping to call at the shop in Laggan (unsure of opening time). I stopped on the way to Laggan to dry the shelter off a bit. Eventually getting there just after 9, I think it was about 6 or 7 miles. Nearly all of which is on the road.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When planning this route, this was what I was always worried about (18 miles majority on roads). I planned a section avoiding some of the road via a tiny place called Phones, then across the moor down into Kingussie.</p>

<p>Anyway I continued on my way from Laggan after stocking up on Sausage Rolls for lunch. I used the back roads rather than the very busy road via Newtonmore. The temperature was hot at 9, and it rose as the day went on. I didn&#8217;t have any suncream, so covered up using my hat and buff.</p>

<p>Eventually not far from the A9 I was caught by another challenger and we talked as we walked along. He walked fast, nearly the same speed I had the day before but that was off road tracks (where I&#8217;m happier). We walked almost to Phones when he said I was slightly too fast and left me. I&#8217;d only speeded up to keep up with him, oh well.</p>

<p>Shortly after though I stopped by a loch for lunch and water. The heat by now was getting to me, I felt far too hot but knew I needed to keep covered up or burn (even more). After leaving the loch the route became open moorland with no breeze and no shelter from the sun.</p>

<p>After what seemed like an eternity I could see the route descending to the A9. I sat down near it and made the wrong decision to push on past Kingussie, which would of been about 2 miles. The reasoning that I could make the following day shorter and hopefully get there by lunch and pop into Aviemore. My feet did hurt but I was having more a problem with the heat which was slightly cooler now I was off the moor.</p>

<p>I continued on turning off more or less opposite the Kingussie turning and had picked a spot I hoped to camp on the map. When I got to Drumguish I texted challenge control to let them know where I was and that I was ok. I thought the signal may go soon after, which it did. I got a message back from Roger thanking me and warning of rain.</p>

<p>I am now probably 2 miles East from Drumguish at a big opening in the Forest with a stream and there is an old building a few hundred yards away, but my feet hurt too much to go and look at it.</p>

<p>I was very releaved when I saw that where I&#8217;d chose on the map was good to pitch, often it&#8217;s boggy or over grown. I didn&#8217;t let myself stop until the Trailstar was pitched and I&#8217;d collected water. Then I took my shoes off and the socks, the Compeed plasters where hanging off in places where the blisters had popped. Others I can see are twice the size they were this morning and both feet are covered with a rash. A heat rash I think, I had one yesterday but it went quickly but after more than 2 hours it&#8217;s still the same.</p>

<p>Once I stopped and then tried to move I could feel the pain. I was so focused earlier I&#8217;d blocked it out. I almost felt like crying just looking at them. I said yesterday that it was worse than when I didn&#8217;t finish the West Highland Way a few years ago but would carry on. Now I&#8217;m not sure I can, which is why I feel upset.</p>

<p>My options are I continue to the camp site at Coylumbridge (Rothiemurchus) where I&#8217;m intending to camp and meet up with Phil which is 12 miles. The other is I walk back in the direction of Kingussie (6 miles to the town) but that means giving up unless I took a day off. I think I will head to Coylumbridge (near Aviemore) as planned, if things are really bad a few miles up the route us Feshie Bridge where there&#8217;s an outdoor centre.</p>

<p>I feel a little better in making the decision, but presuming I get to the campsite (fairly certain I will). I will then have to make a decision about my feet. The Larig ghru is the day after and once on the route, you either walk to the end or turn around and come back. I have to be certain before I set off :-(</p>

<p>Happy I&#8217;m meeting Phil tomorrow, someone I actually know and would welcome his advice. If I had a signal now I would ring someone but sadly I don&#8217;t. That is enough for this post, tune in again to find out what happened next&#8230;</p>
